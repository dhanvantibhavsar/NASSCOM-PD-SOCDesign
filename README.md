### Physical Design Flow
   In the RTL to GDS flow, physical design plays a crucial role. During this stage, the synthesized netlist, design constraints, and standard cell library are used as inputs to generate a layout (GDS file), adhering to the design rules specified by the foundry. This layout is then sent to the foundry for chip fabrication. The entire process of converting a gate-level netlist into a layout is referred to as physical design.

   Physical design consists of multiple stages, each with its own mandatory checks, analyses, and verifications.
   Here is a detailed information.

## Import Design or NetlistIn
The first step in the physical design flow is the Import Design or NetlistIn phase. Here, all relevant design files and constraint files are imported, including the netlist, SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints), UPF (Unified Power Format), DEF (Design Exchange Format), technology files, logical and physical libraries, and TLU+ files.

## Floorplanning or Chip Planning
Floorplanning is a crucial stage in the physical design process. At this point, the netlist, which describes the design and its various blocks along with their interconnections, is utilized. While the netlist provides a logical representation of the ASIC design, floorplanning translates this into a physical layout. This involves mapping the logical description to the physical description by placing blocks or macros within the chip or core area. Key tasks in this phase include:

Determining the width and height of the core and die.
Identifying the locations of predefined cells/macros.
Planning the placement of I/O pins.
Creating the pad ring for the chip.
The main objectives of floorplanning are to minimize both area and delay.

## Placement
Placement involves arranging the standard cells within the design. During this stage, the tool determines the optimal location for each standard cell on the die using internal algorithms. Placement is not merely about positioning the cells from the synthesized netlist; it also involves design optimization and assessing the routability of the layout. Various criteria can drive placement decisions, including timing, congestion, and power optimization. The goals of placement include:

Optimizing area, timing, and power.
Minimizing timing DRCs (Design Rule Checks) and cell/pin density.
Ensuring that the placement is routable.
## Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)
Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) ensures that clock signals are uniformly distributed to all sequential elements within the design. This process involves inserting buffers or inverters along the clock paths to minimize skew. The objectives of CTS are to satisfy clock tree design rule constraints—such as maximum transition, maximum load capacitance, and maximum fanout—while achieving targets like minimal skew and insertion delay.

## Routing
Routing occurs after CTS and determines the precise paths for interconnections within the layout. This process connects various blocks in the chip. With information from the placed cells, blockages, clock tree buffers/inverters, and I/O pins available post-CTS, the routing tool can finalize all connections specified in the netlist. The routing stage employs metal and vias to establish the electrical connections defined by the logical relationships in the netlist. The main objectives of routing include:

Meeting timing constraints.
Avoiding LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) errors.
Ensuring no DRC errors exist.
Minimizing total wire length.
Routing consists of several stages:
a) Global Routing
b) Track Assignment
c) Detailed Routing
d) Search and Repair

## Physical Verification and Signoff
After routing, the layout is prepared for the Physical Verification and Signoff stage. Here, various signoff checks are performed, including physical verification, timing analysis, and logical equivalence checking. Key physical verification checks include:

Layout vs. Schematic (LVS): This compares the layout with the schematic to confirm functional matching. A clean LVS report indicates that they match.
Design Rule Check (DRC): This verifies that the layout adheres to the design rules established by the fabrication team, assessing spacing rules between metals, minimum width rules, via rules, and more.
Electrical Rule Check (ERC) and Antenna Check: Additional checks to ensure electrical integrity.
The equivalence check compares the pre-layout/synthesis netlist with the post-layout netlist generated by the tool after place and route (PnR) to ensure functional consistency.

### DAY 1
 # Task - To run Opnelane flow using 'picorv32a' design and calculate the flop ratio.
  To run the Openlane flow with the picorv32a design and calculate the flop ratio, follow these steps:
  1. Change the directory to Openlane
  2. Create an alias for running Docker
  3. Invoke OpenLane in interactive mode
  4.  Write the Package require

``` 
     cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
     docker
     ./flow.tcl -interactive
     package require openlane 0.9 
     
```
Now run synthesis using following command


`
 run_synthesis
`

![openlane](./images/openlane.png)
![synthesis](./images/runsynthesis.png)

 Calculate the flop ratio

 Flop ratio= Number of D Flip flops/ Total number of cells

 percentage of DFF's = flop ratio x 100

 Here 
 Number of DFF is 1613
 and total number of cells is 14876.
 My flop ratio is 10.842
